Feature: On calling POST Consent Handle request API, verify that on sending consent
  handle request with invalid JWS API signature, the error response is received.

  Scenario: 1042_1 On calling POST Consent Handle request API, use the pre-linked user details
  from settings,send a valid consent request and send the consent handle request on the
  x-jws-signature header using the valid JWS signature with one character added at the end
  and Verify that the error response is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /Consent/handle" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code 400 is received
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from
  current time stamp
    And   Verify that the Error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch
    And   Verify that the version is supported version

  Scenario: 1042_2 On calling POST Consent Handle request API, use the pre-linked user details
  from settings,send a valid consent request and send the consent handle request on the
  x-jws-signature header using the valid JWS signature with one character removed at the end
  and Verify that the error response is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /Consent/handle" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code 400 is received
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from
  current time stamp
    And   Verify that the Error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch
    And   Verify that the version is supported version

  Scenario: 1042_3 On calling POST Consent Handle request API, use the pre-linked user details
  from settings,send a valid consent request and send the consent handle request on the
  x-jws-signature header by generating the JWS signature using a different key that is not
  used anything else and Verify that the error response is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /Consent/handle" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code 400 is received
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from
  current time stamp
    And   Verify that the Error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch/InvalidRequest
    And   Verify that the version is supported version
    And   Verify that the txnid id is same as the txnid from request

  Scenario: 1042_4 On calling POST Consent Handle request API, use the pre-linked user
  details from settings,send a valid consent request and send the consent handle request
  on the x-jws-signature header using the valid JWS signature with a small change done in
  the request body data and Verify that the error response is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /Consent/handle" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code 400 is received
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from
  current time stamp
    And   Verify that the Error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch
    And   Verify that the version is supported version
    And   Verify that the txnid id is same as the txnid from request
