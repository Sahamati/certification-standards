Feature: On calling POST FI Request API, verify that on sending FI request with
  invalid JWS API signature, the error response is received.

  Scenario: 2040_1 On calling POST FI Request API, use the pre-linked user details from
  settings, set a valid FI request. Use the valid JWS signature and add one character at the
  end and send on the x-jws-signature header and Verify that HTTP status code 400 is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /FI/request" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code displayed is HTTP 400
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from current
  time stamp
    And   Verify that the error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch
    And   Verify that the version is supported version

  Scenario: 2040_2 On calling POST FI Request API, use the pre-linked user details from
  settings, set a valid FI request. Use the valid JWS signature and remove the last character
  at the end and send on the x-jws-signature header and Verify that HTTP status code 400 is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /FI/request" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code displayed is HTTP 400
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from current
  time stamp
    And   Verify that the error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch
    And   Verify that the version is supported version

  Scenario: 2040_3 On calling POST FI Request API, use the pre-linked user details from
  settings, set a valid FI request. Generate the JWS signature using a different key that is
  not used for anything and send on the x-jws-signature header and Verify that HTTP status code
  400 is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /FI/request" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code displayed is HTTP 400
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from current
  time stamp
    And   Verify that the error code is SignatureDoesNotMatch/InvalidRequest
    And   Verify that the version is supported version

  Scenario: 2040_4 On calling POST FI Request API, use the pre-linked user details
  from settings, set a valid FI request.Use the valid JWS signature, make a small change
  in the request body data and send on the x-jws-signature header and Verify that HTTP
  status code 400 is received.
    Given Calling the "POST /FI/request" Flow API
    When  POST action is performed
    Then  Verify that the response code displayed is HTTP 400
    And   Verify that the timestamp has the exact format i.e the timestamp is in "+15" or "-15" minutes from current
  time stamp
